[zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee/) is a Python implementation for the [Zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/) project to implement [XBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBee) based [Zigbee](https://www.zigbee.org) radio devices from Digi.

Digi XBee is the brand name of a family of form factor compatible radio modules from Digi International. 

The XBee radios can all be used with the minimum number of connections â€” power (3.3 V), ground, data in and data out (UART), with other recommended lines being Reset and Sleep.[5] Additionally, most XBee families have some other flow control, input/output (I/O), analog-to-digital converter (A/D) and indicator lines built in.

Zigbee Home Automation integration with **[zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/)** allows you to connect one of many off-the-shelf Zigbee adapters using one of the available Zigbee radio library modules compatible with zigpy to control Zigbee based devices, including this **[zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee/)** library for Xbee based Zigbee radio modules. 

[zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/)** currently has support for controlling Zigbee device types such as binary sensors (e.g., motion and door sensors), sensors (e.g., temperature sensors), lightbulbs, switches, and fans. A working implementation of zigbe exist in **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)** (Python based open source home automation software) as part of its **[ZHA component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/zha/)**

## Compatible hardware

zigpy works with separate radio libraries which can each interface with multiple USB and GPIO radio hardware adapters/modules over different native UART serial protocols. Such radio libraries includes **[zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee)** (which communicates with XBee based Zigbee radios), **[bellows](https://github.com/zigpy/bellows)** (which communicates with EZSP/EmberZNet based radios), and as **[zigpy-deconz](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-deconz)** for deCONZ serial protocol (for communicating with ConBee and RaspBee USB and GPIO radios from Dresden-Elektronik). There are also an experimental radio library called **[zigpy-zigate](https://github.com/doudz/zigpy-zigate)** for communicating with ZiGate based radios.

### Known working XBee based Zigbee radio modules for Zigpy

These are XBee Zigbee based radios that have been tested with the [zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee) library for zigpy

- Digi XBee Series 2C (S2C) modules
- Digi XBee Series 2 (S2) modules. Note: These will need to be manually flashed with the Zigbee Coordinator API firmware via XCTU.
- Digi XBee Series 3 (xbee3-24) modules
