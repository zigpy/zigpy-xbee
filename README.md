[zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee/) is a Python implementation for the [Zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/) project to implement [XBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBee) based [Zigbee](https://www.zigbee.org) radio devices from Digi.

Digi XBee is the brand name of a family of form factor compatible radio modules from Digi International. 

The XBee radios can all be used with the minimum number of connections â€” power (3.3 V), ground, data in and data out (UART), with other recommended lines being Reset and Sleep.[5] Additionally, most XBee families have some other flow control, input/output (I/O), analog-to-digital converter (A/D) and indicator lines built in.

Zigbee Home Automation integration with **[zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/)** allows you to connect one of many off-the-shelf Zigbee adapters using one of the available Zigbee radio library modules compatible with zigpy to control Zigbee based devices, including this **[zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee/)** library for Xbee based Zigbee radio modules. 

[zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/)** currently has support for controlling Zigbee device types such as binary sensors (e.g., motion and door sensors), sensors (e.g., temperature sensors), lightbulbs, switches, and fans. A working implementation of zigbe exist in **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)** (Python based open source home automation software) as part of its **[ZHA component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/zha/)**

## Compatible hardware

zigpy works with separate radio libraries which can each interface with multiple USB and GPIO radio hardware adapters/modules over different native UART serial protocols. Such radio libraries includes **[zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee)** (which communicates with XBee based Zigbee radios), **[bellows](https://github.com/zigpy/bellows)** (which communicates with EZSP/EmberZNet based radios), and as **[zigpy-deconz](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-deconz)** for deCONZ serial protocol (for communicating with ConBee and RaspBee USB and GPIO radios from Dresden-Elektronik). There are also an experimental radio library called **[zigpy-zigate](https://github.com/doudz/zigpy-zigate)** for communicating with ZiGate based radios.

### Known working XBee based Zigbee radio modules for Zigpy

These are XBee Zigbee based radios that have been tested with the [zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee) library for zigpy

- [Digi XBee Series 3 (xbee3-24)](https://www.digi.com/products/embedded-systems/digi-xbee/rf-modules/2-4-ghz-rf-modules/xbee3-zigbee-3) and [Digi XBee Series S2C](https://www.digi.com/products/embedded-systems/digi-xbee/rf-modules/2-4-ghz-rf-modules/xbee-zigbee) modules
  - Note! While not a must, [it is recommend to upgrade XBee Series 3 and S2C to newest firmware firmware using XCTU](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/Digidocs/90002002/Default.htm#Tasks/t_load_zb_firmware.htm)
- [Digi XBee Series 2 (S2)](https://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=3430) modules (Note! This first have to be [flashed with Zigbee Coordinator API firmware](https://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=3430))

# Port configuration

- To configure __usb__ port path for your XBee serial device, just specify the TTY (serial com) port, example : `/dev/ttyACM0`

Note! Users can change UART baud rate of your Digi XBee using the Digi's XCTU configuration tool. Using XCTU tool 
enable the API communication mode -- `ATAP2`, set baudrate to 57600 -- `ATBD6`, save parameters.

# Testing new releases

Testing a new release of the zigpy-xbee library before it is released in Home Assistant.

If you are using Supervised Home Assistant (formerly known as the Hassio/Hass.io distro):
- Add https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons-development as "add-on" repository
- Install "Custom deps deployment" addon
- Update config like: 
  ```
  pypi:
    - zigpy-xbee==0.12.0
  apk: []
  ```
  where 0.12.0 is the new version
- Start the addon

If you are instead using some custom python installation of Home Assistant then do this:
- Activate your python virtual env
- Update package with ``pip``
  ```
  pip install zigpy-xbee==0.12.0

# Releases of zigpy-xbee via PyPI

New packages of tagged versions are also released via the "zigpy-xbee" project on PyPI
- https://pypi.org/project/zigpy-xbee/
  - https://pypi.org/project/zigpy-xbee/#history
  - https://pypi.org/project/zigpy-xbee/#files

Older packages of tagged versions are still available on the "zigpy-xbee-homeassistant" project on PyPI
